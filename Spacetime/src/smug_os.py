"""Quantum-inspired SMUG operating suite.

This module groups a set of playful yet well-structured routines used
throughout the repository.  Each routine mirrors a physical intuition –
annihilation, wormhole construction and oracle probing – and is expressed
using clear mathematical metaphors.  The functions are intentionally light
weight so that they can be unit tested without heavy quantum backends while
still matching the symbolic flavour of the project.
