# Clay-PCE Repository Structure

- `P_vs_NP/` – Energy barrier argument for NP-complete languages.
- `Hodge/` – Torsion-flux realisation of harmonic classes.
- `YM_gap/` – Lemma booklet, clustering inequality, and mass-gap proof.
- `Navier_Stokes/` – Torsion-enhanced smoothness argument.
- `Riemann/` – Critical line control for the PCE-rescaled zeta function.
- `BSD/` – Pairing formalism for the Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
- `Common/` – Shared assets including executive summary, experimental brief, and publication packages.

Cross-references: the Yang–Mills lemmas in `YM_gap/lemma_booklet.tex` and `YM_gap/mass_gap_proof.md` feed directly into the experimental brief and lattice publication instructions in `Common/`.
