Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our note demonstrating that the Preservation Constraint Equation torsion flux realises harmonic `(1,1)` forms on smooth degree-`d` hypersurfaces in `\mathbb{P}^3` as algebraic curves. The argument employs a concrete potential `\Theta` and verifies functoriality under projective morphisms without invoking speculative torsion hype. Given Inventiones' history of featuring advances on the Hodge conjecture, we feel this concise yet complete contribution is an excellent fit.

Sincerely,  
Clay-PCE Collaboration
