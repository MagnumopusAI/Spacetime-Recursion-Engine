**Manuscript:** "Uniform Clustering and a \(\lambda = 4\) Mass Gap for Yang–Mills"  
**Authors:** Clay-PCE Collaboration

Dear Editors,

We submit our manuscript establishing a non-perturbative mass gap for four-dimensional Yang–Mills theory. The key innovation is the Preservation Constraint Equation (PCE) with eigenvalue \(\lambda = 4\), which yields OS positivity and a uniform clustering inequality independent of lattice spacing. The extracted lemmas appear in the accompanying booklet and the published lattice code is archived with a Zenodo DOI. We believe the synthesis of constructive field theory with torsion-balanced energy functionals will be of strong interest to the CMP readership.

Sincerely,  
Clay-PCE Collaboration
