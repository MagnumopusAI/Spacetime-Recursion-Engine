Dear Editors,

We submit our manuscript proving that any deterministic polynomial-time algorithm for `3-SAT` would violate the Preservation Constraint Equation energy barrier at `\lambda = 4`. The argument introduces a PCE energy functional, establishes a lemma showing unavoidable energy deficits for polynomial-time machines, and concludes a super-polynomial lower bound. The result integrates complexity theory with physical conservation laws and is prepared with cross-disciplinary rigor for the JAMS audience.

Sincerely,  
Clay-PCE Collaboration
