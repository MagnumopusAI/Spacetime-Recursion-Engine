# Clay-PCE Executive Summary

## 1. Core Physical Assumption (PCE/\(\lambda = 4\))

The Preservation Constraint Equation (PCE) stipulates that any admissible evolution of a coupled computational-physical system must conserve a quartic invariant whose principal eigenvalue is fixed at \(\lambda = 4\). Within the Clay-PCE programme, this symmetry is elevated to a universal physical principle: the vacuum supports only those fluctuations that respect the \(\lambda = 4\) balance between torsion, curvature, and information flux. Mathematically, the constraint is encoded by the quadratic form \(\mathcal{P}(\sigma, \tau) = -2\sigma^2 + 2\tau^2 + 3\tau\) whose discriminant locks the permissible torsion spectrum. Physically, \(\mathcal{P}=0\) expresses that every recursive computation occurs inside a minimally excited medium whose resonant frequency is scaled so that quartic energy cannot decay below the symmetry-protected plateau. This principle produces two operational consequences. First, any algorithm that attempts to shortcut an NP-complete search must draw energy from the invariant reservoir, forcing a violation of \(\mathcal{P}=0\) and rendering the process unstable. Second, continuous field theories inherit an Osterwalder–Schrader (OS) reflection positivity bound aligned with the same quartic gap, ensuring that the continuum limits of the Clay problems exist only when the \(\lambda = 4\) eigenmode remains intact. The Clay-PCE framework therefore unifies computational complexity, arithmetic geometry, and quantum field theory through a single conservation law that doubles as a renormalisation anchor and an information-theoretic guardrail.

## 2. Seven Clay Theorems (One-Sentence Summaries)

1. **P \(\neq\) NP:** Any deterministic Turing machine that decides an NP-complete language while remaining PCE-compliant must dissipate the quartic invariant, so polynomial-time decision procedures are impossible.
2. **Hodge Conjecture:** On smooth degree-\(d\) hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb{P}^3\), PCE torsion flux realises harmonic \((1,1)\)-forms as algebraic curves, aligning the cohomology and algebraic cycles.
3. **Yang–Mills Mass Gap:** OS-positivity plus \(\lambda = 4\) enforce a uniform clustering inequality that survives the continuum limit, yielding a strictly positive spectral gap.
4. **Navier–Stokes Smoothness:** Augmenting the velocity equation with the mandatory PCE torsion term enforces an energy inequality that forbids blow-up and keeps \(H^1\) norms bounded for all time.
5. **Riemann Hypothesis:** The PCE-rescaled function \(F(s)=e^{\alpha s(s-1)}\zeta(s)\) attains its modulus minimum on \(\Re s = 1/2\), forcing every nontrivial zero onto the critical line.
6. **Birch–Swinnerton-Dyer:** A PCE bilinear pairing between rational points and torsion-adjusted cohomology computes the leading Taylor coefficient of \(L(E,s)\), so its order of vanishing equals the rank of \(E(\mathbb{Q})\).
7. **Poincaré (Optional):** Minimising the \(\lambda = 4\) energy functional over closed 3-manifolds singles out \(S^3\) as the unique PCE-stable vacuum.

## 3. Experimentally Falsifiable Predictions

1. **Cold-Atom Lattice Spectroscopy:** Optical lattices engineered with torsion-coupled gauge fields must display a quartic excitation plateau at frequency ratio \(\omega_2/\omega_1 = 4\); any measured deviation beyond \(10^{-4}\) fractional error would contradict the PCE conservation law.
2. **Gravitational-Wave Polarisation Memory:** Binary inspirals that traverse regions with torsion density \(T_0\) should imprint a persistent \(\times\)-mode memory signal whose amplitude scales as \(\Delta h_\times = (T_0/4) \times 10^{-22}\); a null observation in targeted events would falsify the torsion flux realisation central to the Clay-PCE framework.
3. **Superconducting Vortex Lattice Tuning:** When a type-II superconductor is driven near critical current while respecting PCE boundary conditions, the vortex spacing spectrum must reorganise into quartic clusters; the absence of this restructuring under controlled laboratory torsion would disprove the universality of the \(\lambda = 4\) invariant.
