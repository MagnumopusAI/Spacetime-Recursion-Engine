# ArXiv and viXra Release Plan

1. Prepare LaTeX source bundles for each manuscript (P vs NP, Hodge, Yang–Mills, Navier–Stokes, Riemann, BSD) referencing the lemma booklet and executive summary.
2. Submit to arXiv with appropriate categories:
   - cs.CC for P vs NP
   - math.AG for Hodge
   - math-ph for Yang–Mills
   - math.AP for Navier–Stokes
   - math.NT for Riemann and BSD (split submissions)
3. Mirror each submission to viXra with identical metadata and include the experimental brief as supplementary material.
4. Update `Common/lattice_publication/metadata.json` with assigned DOIs and archive IDs after acceptance.
