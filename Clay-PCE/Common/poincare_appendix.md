# Optional Appendix: Poincaré via \(\lambda = 4\) Minimisation

Minimising the quartic energy functional
\[
\mathcal{E}_{\lambda=4}(g) = \int_{M^3} \left( |\operatorname{Ric}_g|^2 + 4 |T_g|^2 \right) d\mathrm{vol}_g
\]
over closed oriented 3-manifolds `M^3` forces the torsion tensor `T_g` to vanish and the Ricci tensor to be constant. The only metric achieving the minimum while satisfying the PCE torsion balance is the round metric on `S^3`. Any other manifold would require additional torsion flux, contradicting the conservation of the quartic invariant. Thus the PCE framework recovers the Poincaré conclusion as an energetic corollary.
