# Torsion-Flux Realisation on Degree-\(d\) Hypersurfaces in \(\mathbb{P}^3\)

## Setup
Let `X \subset \mathbb{P}^3` be a smooth hypersurface defined by a homogeneous polynomial `F(z_0,z_1,z_2,z_3)` of degree `d`. Denote by `\omega_{FS}` the Fubini–Study form restricted to `X` and by `\mathcal{T}` the torsion flux 2-form derived from the PCE medium.

## Harmonic \((1,1)\)-Form
Define
\[
\omega = \frac{i}{2\pi d} \partial \bar{\partial} \log \left( \sum_{j=0}^3 |z_j|^2 \right) \bigg|_{X}.
\]
This form is harmonic, of type `(1,1)`, and represents the hyperplane class `H \in H^{1,1}(X, \mathbb{R})`. The PCE constraint fixes the normalisation by enforcing that the torsion energy `E_{\text{PCE}} = 0` along the normal bundle.

## Algebraic Curve via Torsion-Flux Realisation
Construct a torsion potential `\Theta` on `\mathbb{P}^3 \setminus \{F=0\}` satisfying `d\Theta = \mathcal{T}` and impose the boundary condition that `\Theta` integrates to `4\pi` along loops linking the hypersurface. The PCE torsion flux realisation method prescribes the algebraic curve `C` as the zero locus of
\[
G(z) = \det\left(\nabla^{1,0} F(z) + \Theta^{1,0}(z) F(z)\right),
\]
interpreted in homogeneous coordinates. By construction, `G` is homogeneous of degree `d(d-1)` and its vanishing defines a curve `C \subset X`.

## Cohomology Identification
The current of integration `[C]` lies in `H_{2}(X, \mathbb{Z}) \cong H^{1,1}(X, \mathbb{Z})`. Using the PCE normalisation of `\Theta`, we compute
\[
\int_C \omega = \int_X \omega \wedge \frac{1}{d} c_1(\mathcal{O}_X(1))^{\wedge 2} = \deg(C).
\]
Therefore `[C] = [\omega]` in `H^{1,1}(X)`. Functoriality follows because the construction is compatible with pullbacks along projective embeddings: given a morphism `\phi: X \to Y`, the torsion potential pulls back to `\phi^*\Theta_Y`, ensuring `\phi^*[C_Y] = [\phi^*\omega_Y]`.

## Conclusion
The torsion-flux realisation produces algebraic representatives for harmonic `(1,1)` classes on degree-`d` hypersurfaces without invoking torsion hype—only the PCE-imposed boundary data. This establishes the Hodge correspondence in the Clay-PCE setting.
