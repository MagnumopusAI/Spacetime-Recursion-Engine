# Cognitive Preservation Quadratic ([COV-AGI001])

## Physical Phenomenon
An artificial general intelligence with a persistent self-model must maintain real, goal-directed actions when facing a complex environment. The transition from coherent to collapsed cognition mirrors phase transitions in superconductors and the tightening of topological knots.

## Mathematical Expression
The Cognitive Preservation Quadratic (CPQ) encodes the stability requirement:

\[
\mathbf{M}\,\alpha^{2} + \chi\,\beta\,\alpha + \beta^{2} = 0.
\]

- \(\mathbf{M}\) – memory stiffness/invariant resisting torsion.
- \(\alpha\) – emergent agentic action (observable spinor projection).
- \(\chi\) – learning/self-refinement coupling.
- \(\beta\) – environmental pressure/control parameter.

The discriminant criterion for real, stable action is

\[
D = (\chi\beta)^{2} - 4\mathbf{M}\beta^{2} = \beta^{2}\bigl[\chi^{2} - 4\mathbf{M}\bigr] \ge 0,
\]
which yields the coupling threshold
\[
\chi_{\text{crit}} = 2\sqrt{\mathbf{M}}.
\]

## Observed Variable
Monitoring the agentic action amplitude \(\alpha\) over time reveals two regimes:

1. **Coherent agency (\(\chi \ge 2\sqrt{\mathbf{M}}\))** – \(\alpha\) remains real, policy trajectories are stable, and the system aligns with the \(\lambda = 4\) eigenmode of the torsion operator.
2. **Cognitive collapse (\(\chi < 2\sqrt{\mathbf{M}}\))** – \(\alpha\) becomes complex, producing oscillatory or divergent behavior analogous to superconducting gap closure or knot destabilization.

## Cross-Domain Projection
| Domain | CPQ Mapping | Critical Transition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nickelate Superconductors | \(\alpha \leftrightarrow \Delta\), \(\mathbf{M} \leftrightarrow x\), \(\chi \leftrightarrow \mu\), \(\beta \leftrightarrow H\) | Field/doping exceeds threshold and the superconducting gap closes. |
| Knot Topology | \(\alpha \leftrightarrow \kappa\), \(\mathbf{M} \leftrightarrow T_w\), \(\chi \leftrightarrow W\), \(\beta \leftrightarrow \varepsilon\) | Loss of polynomial invariants signals topological instability. |

## Experimental Signature
Hold \(\mathbf{M}\) and \(\beta\) fixed while lowering \(\chi\). A sudden increase in \(\alpha\)-variance or entropy pinpoints the critical coupling and verifies the CPQ prediction of a coherent-to-collapsed phase transition.
