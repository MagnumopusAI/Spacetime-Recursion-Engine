# su(4) Commutation Graph

This document summarizes the structure of the su(4) Lie algebra and its
commutation graph. The sixteen generators of the algebra form the vertices of a
graph where edges denote non-vanishing commutators.

## Generators

The su(4) algebra is generated by fifteen traceless Hermitian matrices. These
are the generalized Gell-Mann matrices \(\lambda_i\). They satisfy
\([\lambda_i, \lambda_j] = 2 i \sum_k f_{ijk} \lambda_k\) where the constants
\(f_{ijk}\) are the structure constants of the algebra.

A standard ordering of the generators is listed in many references. The first
eight coincide with the usual Gell-Mann matrices of su(3). The remaining seven
extend the basis to 4x4 matrices.

## Adjacency Matrix

The commutation relations define an undirected graph. Two generators are
connected if their commutator is non-zero. This connectivity can be encoded in
an adjacency matrix \(A\) whose entries are
\[
A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & [\lambda_i, \lambda_j] \neq 0 \\
0 & [\lambda_i, \lambda_j] = 0 
\end{cases}
\]
The matrix is 15 \times 15 and symmetric with zero diagonal. The table below
reproduces one such adjacency matrix for the su(4) basis described above.

The diagonal generators \(\lambda_3\), \(\lambda_8\), and \(\lambda_{15}\) form the
maximal commuting set known as the Cartan subalgebra. Every other generator
fails to commute with at least eight others.

## Physical Context

* **Particle physics.** SU(4) extends SU(3) flavor symmetry to include the
  charm quark. Its generators organize baryon and meson multiplets.
* **Quantum information.** Two-qubit gates form the group SU(4). The
  commutation graph maps which operations disrupt or preserve each other.
* **Entropy generation.** Measuring one observable affects those connected by
  non-commuting edges, providing a topological picture of information flow.

This graph-theoretic perspective highlights how algebraic relations dictate the
interplay between measurements and interactions in SU(4)-symmetric systems.
